# Spatial Document Viewer

In collaboration with Textgain we have developed a 3D Spatial document viewer. We used technologies
such as React, ThreeJS, NodeJS and MongoDB to build an interactive platform. Discover clusters,
query data with complex filters, view documents in a 3D space and more!  

This repository contains the web-client of this project.
With our intuitive UI you can easily query and navigate large quantities of data.
Engineered to be open and flexible.
